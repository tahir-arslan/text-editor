## Description
This Note Taker application allows a user to write and save notes. It includes a server with routes to access the front end, as well as api routes to communicate with the database.

The user is able to create a new note, which only then a save button becomes available. Once the note is saved, a unique ID is applied to the note through a calculation implemented in `/routes/apiRoutes/noteRoutes.js`. Upon clicking a saved note, it will apply the unique ID to display the selected note on the screen. The user is also able to delete any saved notes.

This project is also deployed on [heroku](https://murmuring-headland-68396.herokuapp.com/)
